# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Assessment
This Jupter Notebook explores the tips dataset bas on the instructions found [here](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-2019-fundda/raw/master/project.pdf). This dataset contains the tipping data of a restaurant over a four day period. The dataset contains seven variables: total bill, tip, smoker/non-smoker, sex, day, time, and party size. I will further explore the relationship between these variables, particularly their impact on the tip.
